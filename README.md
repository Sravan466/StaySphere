#StaySphere – Full-Stack Airbnb Clone

StaySphere is a full-featured vacation rental web application inspired by Airbnb. It allows users to list, browse, and manage properties for short-term stays. Built with a focus on maintainability and scalability, the app follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS for server-side rendering.
