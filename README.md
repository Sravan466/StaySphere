StaySphere is a full-featured vacation rental web application inspired by Airbnb. It allows users to list, browse, and manage properties for short-term stays. Built with a focus on maintainability and scalability, the app follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern using **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **EJS** for server-side rendering.

From listing creation to user authentication, StaySphere replicates the core functionality of Airbnb while maintaining a clean backend structure and a responsive, user-friendly interface.
